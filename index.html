  <h3><span>Political Instability</span></h3>
  <p>Congo has a history of political instability, stemming from colonization, authoritarian rule, and conflict. Since gaining independence from Belgium in 1960, the country has experienced several coup attempts, civil wars, and power struggles. Currently, there is a rebel group called the M23 Rebels that were able to get a grasp of the country because of it's political instability which specifically happened after violent national elections which occured in December 2023. This group mistreats the people of Congo, but are able to get away with it. </p>

    <h3><span>Resource Exploitation</span></h3>
    <p>Because Congo is so rich in resources, it is a hotspot for several big corporations such as Apple, Google, and Tesla who own several mines throughout the country. In order for these companies to mine the resources that they need from Congo, they exploit the people of Congo to work for little to no pay. These companies sometimes work with the M23 Rebels to collect and displace the people of Congo out of their homes to go work in the mines.</p>

  <h3><span>Displacement</span></h3>
  <p>The amount of people being displaced from their homes is mainly because of the M23 Rebels forcing people from their homes to work in the mines, as well as the severe clashes between the Congolese military and the M23 Rebels. This issue is occuring throughout the nation and as of April 2024, 6.9 million people have been displaced from their homes.</p>
